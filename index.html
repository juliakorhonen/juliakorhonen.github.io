          <h2> Customer Scene Investigation - Group project for the course “User-Centered Methods for Product and Service Design” </h2>
            <p>
              In a group of four students, we analyzed the user experience of webinars held by a Finnish institute. The webinars had been previously before the covid-19 organized as traditional seminars but they had to be transferred into online form. We interviewed the participants, speakers and moderators of the webinars to get an understanding of the practicalities, the roles, the experiences and challenges of the webinars. The interviews were transcribed. My key responsibility regarding the gathering of the data was the user observation. I participated in two webinars and took notes about e.g. the number of participants, the schedule, the usability of the platform, the questions asked, the technical problems occurred and the interaction between the moderator, the speaker and the participants. We also created a questionnaire to gather more feedback and thoughts from the users.

              <br><br>The data from interviews, observations and questionnaires was gathered together and they were coded and clustered into different categories forming an affinity diagram. We analyzed the data and came up with the main user groups. For each user group we created a Persona, which included the background, motivations, frustrations and technology experience of the user group representative. We also did a hierarchical task analysis which represented the steps the users take in order to participate in the webinar. This included for example the detailed steps needed for finding the information about the webinars, putting them to the calendar, joining the webinar and participating in the discussion during the webinar. We also created scenarios which indicated different possible stories of how the users might behave in the webinars and what are their main challenges.

              <br><br>We also made a list of the different stakeholders of this case, both internal and external. Finally, we made a customer journey map and analyzed the user experience of different user groups and satisfaction at the various phases, and pointed out the pain points and implications.

          <h2> Creating a mobile application UI for recording planted trees </h2>
            <p>
              This project was done in a group of 4 for User Interface Construction course. The idea was to design a prototype platform for adding data about planted trees in Zambia and also add growth updates to already planted trees. Attention is especially paid to the usability and clarity of the design.
              <br><br>First we designed individually separate parts for the UI using different user interface design guidelines, and then we integrated them into one similar design.
              The prototypes were designed using InVision. The initial version of my part can be viewed <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/ckifz6h6x000n7901vv38b4ec/play" target="_blank">here.</a>
              <br><br>The video is edited by me using Sony Vegas.

          <h2> Training Ducks to Collect Bread - Machine Learning Agents in Unity </h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://jesnuka.github.io/DuckPool/" target="_blank">DuckPool</a> is a machine learning project made together with Jesse Nukarinen for Artificial Intelligence and Applied Methods course in Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.
              The project was built in Unity, programmed with C#.

              <br><br>The goal of the project was to train a virtual duck to be the most efficient at finding bread in a contained environment with limited time.
              It was done using Unity and an Unity plugin called
              <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents">The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents)</a>.
              This plugin enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. The agents can be trained using different machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API. The 3D Models were made using Blender.

              <br><br>The view has two different ducks, the other with no training and another one that has had training with speed multiplied by 100 for the duration of 3 hours.

          <h2> Creating a mobile application UI for recording planted trees <h2>
            <p>
              This project was done in a group of 4 for User Interface Construction course. The idea was to design a prototype platform for adding data about planted trees in Zambia and also add growth updates to already planted trees.
              <br><br>First we designed individually separate parts for the UI using different guidelines, and then we integrated them into one similar design.
              The prototypes were designed using InVision. The initial version of my part can be viewed <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/ckifz6h6x000n7901vv38b4ec/play" target="_blank">here.</a>
              <br><br>The video is edited by me using Sony Vegas.

          <h2> Training Ducks to Collect Bread - Machine Learning Agents in Unity <h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://jesnuka.github.io/DuckPool/" target="_blank">DuckPool</a> is a machine learning project made together with Jesse Nukarinen for Artificial Intelligence and Applied Methods course in Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.
              The project was built in Unity, programmed with C#.

              <br><br>The goal of the project was to train a virtual duck to be the most efficient at finding bread in a contained environment with limited time.
              It was done using Unity and an Unity plugin called
              <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents">The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents)</a>.
              This plugin enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. The agents can be trained using different machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API. The 3D Models were made using Blender.

              <br><br>The view has two different ducks, the other with no training and another one that has had training with speed multiplied by 100 for the duration of 3 hours.
